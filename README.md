## SOVIET &#9773;


### Soviet is always under active development until further notice. Use at your own risk.

Test website for Soviet Linux.

It's very minimal right now, and is intended to be a platform to build upon.

The final production version will use Parsedown PHP. This will let us use Markdown to create our content, and keep people from interacting directly with the site code.

_Soviet_ is designed to be easy to maintain by users that may not have html/css knowledge. It's a minimal site that uses no Javascript and minimal PHP.

TO-DO:
+ needs content
+ add comments to code
+ ~~more \<meta\> tags~~
+ tidy up the indentation
+ standardize class order
+ ~~fix the jaggy bit coming off Tux's arm~~
+ ~~sucks _terribly_ still(?) on mobile!!~~
