## SOVIET ##


THIS IS A TEST WEBSITE!! DO NOT USE IT FOR ANYTHING!!

Test website for Soviet Linux.

The purpose is to have a place for the organization to review the site, provide content ideas, and make suggestions for improvements.

It's very minimal right now, and is intended to be a platform to build upon.

The final production version will use a small amount of PHP (which Github doesn't support), namely Parsedown. This will let us use Markdown to create our content, and keep people from interacting directly with the site code.

_Soviet_ is designed to be easy to maintain by users that may not have html/css knowledge. It's a minimal site that uses no Javascript and minimal PHP.

TO-DO:
+ needs content
+ add comments to code
+ more <meta> items
+ tidy up the indentation
+ standardize class order
+ fix the jaggy bit coming off Tux's arm
