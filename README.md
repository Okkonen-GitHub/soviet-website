__THIS IS A TEST WEBSITE!! DO NOT USE IT FOR ANYTHING!!__

Test website for Soviet Linux.

The purpose is to have a place for the organization to review the site, provide content ideas, and make suggestions for improvements.

It's very minimal right now, and is intended to be a platform to build upon.

The final production version will use a small amount of PHP (which Github doesn't support), namely [Parsedown](https://parsedown.org/). This will let us use Markdown to create our content, and keep people from interacting directly with the site code.
